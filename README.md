## Features
1. Interactive gui for designing robot autos.
2. Supports holomonic & differental drivebases.
3. Built in scripting blocks that allow you to exectue robot code via reflection.
4. Iterate without deploying. This tool uses networktables to upload your autonomous to the robot so you can quickly iterate without slowing down.
5. See how long your auto will take before you deploy. We're using the same trajectory and path planner that your robot uses. What you see is what you will get!
6. Real-time feedback. The path that your robot drives will be visible in the gui. Use this too see where things are going wrong and quickly fix them.
