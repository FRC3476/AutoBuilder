## Features
1. Interactive gui for designing robot autos.
2. Command based script items to allow you to control other parts of the robot.
3. Iterate without deploying. This tool uses networktables to upload your autonomous to the robot so you can quickly iterate without slowing down.
4. See how long your auto will take before you deploy. We're using the same trajectory and path planner that your robot uses. What you see is what you will get!
5. Real-time feedback. The path that your robot drives will be visible in the gui. Use this too see where things are going wrong and quickly fix them.
